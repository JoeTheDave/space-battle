> ## Ship systems and Energy Allocation
>
> - Repairs - repairs damage to the ship.
> - Shields - charges shields to deflect weapons fire and colisions with other ships.
> - Weapons - charges weapons so your ship can fire.
> - Thrusters - powers thrusters which accelerate the ship. A ship will maintain momentum even if thrusters are deactivated.
> - Sensors - powers ship sensors to scan for enemy ships and weapons fire.
>
> All systems require energy to function and function more optimally at higher energy levels
>
> Each ship has capacity to power one system at 100% capacity, but can divide that erergy among all systems. For instance, all systems can operate simultaneously at 20% capacity.
>
> It takes time to tranfer energy between systems. Energy will flow into and out of systems at the rate of 10% per second. If multiple systems are ramping up or down at the same time, that bandwidth is divided between systems.
>
> If 100% of energy is not being used, the leftover energy is automatically diverted to the ships energy reserves.
>
> If all systems are powered down and 100% of energy is diverted to reserves, reserves will fill to maximum in 10 seconds.
>
> It is possible to operate systems such that more than 100% of ship energy capacity is being used. Any energy beyond 100% will draw energy from the ship's energy reserves. If a ship's systems are running at 200% energy capacity, it will take 10 seconds to completely drain a full energy reserve.
>
> If ship's systems run above 100% capacity and energy reserves are depleted, the ship will begin lose structural integrity at the same rate of loss as the energy reserves.
>
> It is possible to run all ship systems at 100% capacity, but the ship will drain energy reserves and lose structural integrity very quickly.
>
> Once a ship reaches 0% structural integrity, the ship is destroyed.
